- Ruby on Rails `7.1.1`
  ```
  sudo gem install rails -v 7.1.1
  ```
  then restart the terminal and input
  `rails -v` if saying `7.1.1`, you are good to go.

- Installed Gem package:<br>
  None (all included in gemfile)

## Set up:
- Once you clone the project of your native env, double check the techs and framework version that you are using
- run `bundle update` until you get the return without errors.
- Then you can set up to the local server to test, eg:

  ```
  rails server -p 4001
  ```
Then go to `localhost:4001`.
