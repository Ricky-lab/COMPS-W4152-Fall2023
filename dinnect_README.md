### Pain Points We Are Addressing

For students at Columbia University, finding suitable dining companions is necessary in daily life, as different students may have different dietary preferences and restrictions. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive platform that facilitates this and helps Columbia students connect with like-minded peers for meal planning and dining.

- ### Adapting to Columbia's Diverse Academic Landscape and Urban Setting

**Columbia University**, known for its diverse student body and rigorous academic environment, faces a unique challenge due to the swift turnover of students. With a substantial number of students completing their programs within two years and a continuous influx of new students, it's imperative to provide a platform that efficiently caters to their diverse academic and social needs. The urban location in New York City amplifies the urgency for a comprehensive platform that extends beyond its initial dining focus. This enables students to swiftly connect with their peers, explore the city's offerings, and enrich their academic and social experiences. This shift aligns seamlessly with the university's commitment to enhancing campus life, promoting student well-being, and fostering a secure and inclusive environment.

- ### Fostering Vibrancy and Inclusivity Through Campus Activities

The rapid turnover of students at **Columbia University** underscores the need for expedited social connections and vibrant campus life. By pivoting towards organizing campus activities, the platform aims to accelerate these connections, fostering dynamic social networks within and beyond the campus. Its focus on offering students opportunities to engage in diverse activities, including club meetings and cultural events, caters to the fast-paced nature of student life. Notably, while ensuring security remains a priority, the platform's response to the swift student flow underscores the trust and camaraderie within the Columbia University community, making it an essential component of student life.

- ### Ensuring Security in a Trusted Campus Community

In light of the rapid student turnover and the associated need for quick connections, the platform can harness the inherent trust within the Columbia University community to enhance security and inclusivity. The expeditious nature of students' academic journeys calls for proactive security measures, including member verification and robust activity monitoring. These measures not only address security concerns but also contribute to the sense of trust and community that is vital in a fast-paced academic environment where connections need to be established swiftly.
